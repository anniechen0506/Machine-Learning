# Machine-Learning-Fall-2023
Repo for GB656 Machine Learning at UW-Madison

Taught by Daniel Bauer

Outcomes:
1. Build machine learning models for the purpose of prediction, choosing from a variety of statistical learning techniques.
2. Adjust models and tune parameters, taking into account the fundamental bias-variance tradeoff.
3. Evaluate prediction accuracy of models for regression and classification problems.
4. Interpret the prediction outcomes of a given machine learning model, and communicate the results to non-expert audiences.
